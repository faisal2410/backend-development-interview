******** Rest API Http Methods Best Practices ********


Basically, for CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) we can use the HTTP methods as follows:

    i. POST: create resource or search operation
    ii. GET: read resource operation
    iii. PUT: update resource operation
    iv. DELETE: remove resource operation
    v. PATCH: partial update resource operation


i. API end point with POST method:
Used mainly for Create resource operations, or Read operations in some certain cases:

    * Read resource if URL / query string exceeds maximum allowed characters. Maximum length of URL and query string is 2,048 characters.
    *. Read resource if query parameters contain sensitive information

Return status code:
    * 200 OK for successful read operation if the response contains data
    * 201 Created for successful create operation
    * 204 No Content for successful read operation if the response contains NO data


ii. API end point with GET method:

Return status code:
    * 200 OK if the response contains data
    * 204 No Content if the response contains no data


iii. API end point with PUT method:

Return status code:
    * 200 OK if the response contains data
    * 204 No Content if the response contains no data
