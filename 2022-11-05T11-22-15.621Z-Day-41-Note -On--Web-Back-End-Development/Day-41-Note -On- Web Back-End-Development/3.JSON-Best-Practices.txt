******** JSON Best Practices ********

What is JSON?

* JSON describes JavaScript Object Notation.

* JSON is a data interchange format that is easy to parse and generate. 

* JSON is an extension of the syntax used to describe object data in JavaScript. 

* Yet, it’s not restricted to use with JavaScript. It has a text format that uses object and array structures for the portable representation of data. 

* All modern programming languages support these data structures, making JSON completely language independent.

* The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json.

* The file extension is .json.

* It was designed for human-readable data interchange. That's why it’s not secure data interchange format.

* We encrypt and decrypt the JSON for data security.



Uses of JSON:
* It is used while JavaScript based applications that includes browser extensions and websites.

* JSON format is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over network connection.

* It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and web applications.

* Web services and APIs use JSON format to provide public data.



Characteristics of JSON:
* JSON is easy to read and write.
* It is a lightweight text-based interchange format.
* JSON is language independent.



JSON Structure:
{ 
    "name":"Katherine Johnson", 
    "age":101,
    "orbital_mechanics": ["trajectories","launch windows","emergency return paths"], 
    "mathmatician": true, 
    "last_location": null 
}



JSON Data Types:
* string – Literal text that’s enclosed in quotes.
* number – Positive or negative integers or floating point numbers.
* object – A key, value pair enclosed in curly braces
* array – A collection of one or more JSON objects.
* boolean – A value of either true or false with no quotes.
* whitespace - Can be used between any pair of tokens.
* null – Indicates the absence of data for a key value pair, represented as “null” with no quotes.



JSON Bad Special Characers & Solution:
The following characters are reserved characters and can not be used in JSON and must be properly escaped to be used in strings.

* Backspace to be replaced with \b
* Form feed to be replaced with \f
* Newline to be replaced with \n
* Carriage return to be replaced with \r
* Tab to be replaced with \t
* Double quote to be replaced with \"
* Backslash to be replaced with \\

JSONObject.escape() method can be used to escape such reserved keywords in a JSON String.

    Code Example:
        import org.json.simple.JSONObject;

        public class JsonDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject();
            String text = "Text with special character /\"\'\b\f\t\r\n.";
            System.out.println(text);
            System.out.println("After escaping.");
            text = jsonObject.escape(text);
            System.out.println(text);
        }
        }

    Output:
        Text with special character /"'
        .
        After escaping.
        Text with special chara

    * Use JSON Lint to format and valid JSON Data List


Always enclose the Key: Value pair within double quotes:
    * {'id': '1', 'name': Sayed} is not right
    * {"id": 1, "name": "Sayed"} is okay
    * {"id": "1", "name": "Sayed"} is the best


Never use Hyphens in Key Fields:
    * {"first-name": "Abu", "last-name": "Sayed"} is not right.
    * {"first_name": "Abu", "last_name": "Sayed"} is okay.
    * {"firstname": "Abu", "lastname": "Sayed"} is okay.
    * {"firstName": "Abu", "lastName": "Sayed"} is the best. Using camel case is the best practice.



Always create a root element:

    JSON with root element---
    {
        "phone":[
            {
                "type":"home",
                "phoneNo": "01558 585858"
            },
            {
                "type":"work",
                "phoneNo": "01558 835966"
            }
        ]
    }

    JSON without root element---
    [
        {
            "type":"home",
            "phoneNo": "01558 585858"
        },
        {
            "type":"work",
            "phoneNo": "01558 835966"
        }
    ]
