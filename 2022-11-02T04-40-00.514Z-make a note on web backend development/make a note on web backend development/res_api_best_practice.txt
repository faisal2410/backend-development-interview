Best API practices:
   Use JSON format for sending and receaving Data
   User Nouns Instead of Verbs in Endpoints
   Name collection with Plural Nouns
   Use Status Codes in Error Handling
   Use Nesting on Endpoints to show relationship
   Use Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination to Retrive the Data Request
   Use SSL for security
